## Technologies Used

- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React**: Beautiful, customizable icons
- **ESLint**: Code linting and formatting

## Extensibility

The application is designed to be easily extensible:

### Adding New Roles

Edit `src/data/roles.js` to add new professional roles:

```javascript
{
  id: 'new_role',
  name: 'New Role Name',
  description: 'Description of the role and its expertise'
}
```

### Supporting Additional AI Models

The prompt generation logic is modular. To add support for other AI models:

1. Create new generator functions in `src/utils/promptGenerator.js`
2. Add model selection to the UI
3. Implement model-specific XML/prompt formats

### Customizing Prompt Structure

Modify the `generateClaudePrompt` function in `src/utils/promptGenerator.js` to adjust the XML structure or add new sections.
